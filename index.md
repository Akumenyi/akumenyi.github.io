Hello and welcome! Kwesi is a seasoned climate research scientist with extensive experience in climate modeling, climate extremes analysis, and risk assessment. His expertise includes modeling the impact of solar geoengineering on climate extremes, focusing on developing innovative solutions to mitigate climate change and its associated risks. Kwesi has consulted for the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the World Academy of Sciences, and ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability. Currently, he is on a research stay at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and has lectures at both the University of Cape Coast and the University of Cape Town.
 
Dr. Quagraineâ€™s research interests span climate geoengineering, climate extreme events, regional climate modeling, climate change impacts and adaptation, climate resilience and vulnerability, tropical meteorology, monsoon dynamics, and climate data analytics and machine learning approaches. He holds a PhD in Environmental and Geographical Science from the University of Cape Town, an M.Phil. in Physics from the University of Cape Coast, and a B.Sc. (Hons.) in Physics from the same institution. He is committed to bridging advanced climate science and practical solutions for sustainable development.

Kwesi earned his Ph.D. at the University of Cape Town, working with Prof. Bruce Hewitson [https://tinyurl.com/Bruce-Hewitson] on developing a methodology to understand the co-behavior of climate processes over Southern Africa [http://hdl.handle.net/11427/33916].

Prior to beginning my Ph.D., I earned my M.Phil. & a B.Sc. at the Department of Physics, University of Cape Coast, Ghana where I was advised by Prof. Nana Ama Browne Klutse [https://tinyurl.com/Ama-Browne] where I sought to understand the West African Monsoon (WAM) jump and its implication for Agriculture [https://tinyurl.com/quagraine-thesis].
